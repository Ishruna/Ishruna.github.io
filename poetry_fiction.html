					<p> 	Oh muse, my muse…				<br>
						Tears at you, ripping you apart,		<br>
						the push and pull of gray tides,		<br>
						a sickening nightmare.				<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						You struggle for the shore,			<br>
						Unyielding, yet fragile.			<br>
						Your legs go numb,				<br>
						gasping for one last breath.			<br>

					</p>
					<p>
						The waves long to engulf you.			<br>
						At last, you succumb.				<br>
						Is it so awful?					<br>
						Perhaps, it is not.				<br>

					</p>
					<p>
						For I am here, my dearest			<br>
						Floating beside you, my ghost			<br>
						Scorched and perished, a thousand times,	<br>
						crossing over the burning bridge.		<br>

					</p>
					<p>
						I offer you my last flame,			<br>
						though flickering and dying,			<br>
						to keep you afloat.				<br>
						Because your life is my delight.		<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Breathe, my muse.				<br>
						Live one more day.				<br>
						In the late hours of the night,			<br>
						n the hidden valleys and shadows,		<br>
						may you find me.				<br>
